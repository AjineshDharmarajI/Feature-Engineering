#Diabetes Anomaly Detection
This project demonstrates multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify diabetes. By exploring different approaches, we aim to improve the detection of outliers that indicate potential fraud. Methods implemented include Z-Score, Mahalanobis Distance, Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM.

#Project Structure
data/: Contains the credit card dataset (e.g., creditcard.csv).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and anomaly detection.
scripts/: Python scripts for data loading, model evaluation, and visualization.

#Dataset
The dataset used is a Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle.

#Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone (https://github.com/Souravsurendren/Feature-Engineering-Demo.git)
