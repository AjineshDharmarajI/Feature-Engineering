# Diabetes Anomaly Detection

This project demonstrates multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify diabetes. By exploring different approaches, we aim to improve the detection of outliers that may indicate potential fraud. The methods implemented include Z-Score, Mahalanobis Distance, Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the diabetes dataset (e.g., `diabetes.csv`).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and anomaly detection.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data loading, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used is a [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from Kaggle.
